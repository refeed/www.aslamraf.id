    <h1>Hey there! I'm Rafid Aslam üöÄ</h1>
    <p>
        Hailing from the vibrant archipelago of Indonesia, my journey into the tech realm started early. Currently, I'm honing my skills and expanding my knowledge as a student of Software Engineering Technology at Vocational College Gadjah Mada University. Even before university life, I dived deep into the world of Linux, becoming a devoted user back in my 10th grade in 2016. üêß

        My university journey aligns with my passion that began much earlier. In 2016, the same year I embraced Linux, I stepped foot into the enthralling world of open source. To me, contributing to open source is more than just coding; it's about joining a community that champions knowledge sharing and collective advancement.

        My coding endeavors are characterized by efficiency and elegance. I've refined my techniques using vim hotkeys, ensuring each keystroke is purposeful. And, as someone who sees code as poetry, every line I pen is a testament to functionality and readability. üíª

        In 2018, my journey took a mentorship turn. I proudly guided a budding tech enthusiast through the Google Summer of Code. Imparting my knowledge and insights was an enriching experience, highlighting the importance of community growth and collective learning.
